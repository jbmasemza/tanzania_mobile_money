# The training dataset contains demographic information and what financial services are used by approximately 10,000 individuals across Tanzania. This data was extracted from the FSDT Finscope 2017 survey and prepared specifically for this challenge.

# Each individual is classified into four mutually exclusive categories:

    # No_financial_services: Individuals who do not use mobile money, do not save, do not have credit, and do not have insurance
    # Other_only: Individuals who do not use mobile money, but do use at least one of the other financial services (savings, credit, insurance)
    # Mm_only: Individuals who use mobile money only
    # Mm_plus: Individuals who use mobile money and also use at least one of the other financial    services (savings, credit, insurance)

# This dataset is the geospatial mapping of all cash outlets in Tanzania in 2012. Cash outlets in this case included commercial banks, community banks, ATMs, microfinance institutions, mobile money agents, bus stations and post offices. This data was collected by FSDT.

Conclusion

After analysing the dataframe of Tanzanian mobile money users containing 7094 records, it is clear that clear the people still prefer using cash over mobile money. Lot of people still do not use mobile money more often to purchase and recieve funds.
Young people are active mobile money users than old people, so they still a large number of people who are not using the mobile money services. I think with the right campaigns the mobile money service providers still can reach more clients.
Married people are target for the mobile money services as they is more of them using it. Traders make more money but not most of them use the mobile money services, so I think they are also the right target market to approach. I think the mobile money services can grow its subscription as there is still a huge number of people who are their target market.
