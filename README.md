Conclusion

After analysing the dataframe of Tanzanian mobile money users containing 7094 records, it is clear that clear the people still prefer using cash over mobile money. Lot of people still do not use mobile money more often to purchase and recieve funds.
Young people are active mobile money users than old people, so they still a large number of people who are not using the mobile money services. I think with the right campaigns the mobile money service providers still can reach more clients.
Married people are target for the mobile money services as they is more of them using it. Traders make more money but not most of them use the mobile money services, so I think they are also the right target market to approach. I think the mobile money services can grow its subscription as there is still a huge number of people who are their target market.
